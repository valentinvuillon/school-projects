ENG-458 programming concepts in scientific computing.
Master course for the computational science and engineering minor, EPFL.
Autumn semester 2023.

This course gave taught students how to program in c++ for scientific computing applications. The main focus of the course was on object oriented programing.

Here is the final project I have done for this course. It consisted in making an ODE solver implementing different integration methods, using object oriented programing.
