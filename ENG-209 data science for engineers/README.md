This repository contains the exercises and the final project for the course ENG-209 data science for engineers.
I took this course during my second year of bachelor in the electrical engineering at EPFL, during the autumn semester 2020.

The final project is located under the "final" directory. The project was done in groups of 2. I did it with rafael Riber https://github.com/RafaelRiber
The goal of the final project was to analyse CO2 data in switzerland.
