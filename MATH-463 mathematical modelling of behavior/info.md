MATH-463 mathematical modelling of behavior.
Master course for the computational science and engineering minor, EPFL.
Autumn semester 2023.

It contains the final project made in groups of 3.

The goal of the final project was to predict the chosen transport mode of citizens (walking, taking the car, taking the bus...) using mathematical models. The used data contains 
travels done by citizens with information about the citizens and their choice of transport.

The project has been done with Alexander Dybdahl https://github.com/alexander-dybdahl and Alexia Paratte https://github.com/araccoon22
